<h1 align="center">❤Hi 👋  I'm Jason!❤</h1>
<br>
I am a creative and talented web & mobile developer with in-depth knowledge of React, Next.js, React Native, and Node.js, for vibrant UI friendly and high-performance websites and mobile applications.

I have 8 years of experience designing useful, approachable user interfaces and mobile applications. I'm very knowledgeable on all aspects of Facebook's design best practices and emerging UI development techniques, and well versed in middle-wares such as Redux-Thunk and React-Redux, and MongoDB.

I live and breathe tech, and I'm darn good at it!
