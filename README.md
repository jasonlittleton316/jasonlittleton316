<h1 align="center">‚ù§Hi üëã  I'm Jason!‚ù§</h1>
<br>
<p>I am a senior web and mobile app developer with in-depth knowledge of React, React Native, iOS(Objective-C, Swift), and Node.js, specializing in the creation of vibrant, user-friendly, and high-performance web and mobile applications.

Boasting 8 years of extensive experience, I have cultivated a strong technical background in developing web and mobile applications with highly intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces along with high-performance features.

I am highly knowledgeable about all aspects of Facebook's design best practices and emerging UI development techniques. Moreover, I am well-versed in middleware technologies such as Redux-Thunk and React-Redux, as well as in working with MongoDB.

I've worked on iOS frameworks and libraries, and I have extensive experience with UIKit, Core Data, Core Animation, and other relevant frameworks used in developing iOS applications.

I live and breathe technology, and I'm darn good at it!</p>
